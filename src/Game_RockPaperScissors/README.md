## Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic. In this simple Java program I recreated the game. Below a few screenshots will illustrate how it all works:

The user (Player 1) after running the program, will be prompted to type one of the three words (not case sensitive) representing their choice

after inserting the word, the program will randomly choose which between rock, paper and scissors for Player 2 and will display who won:

The program will start over again and ask again for the user to make a choice. The user can play as many times as they want, once they decide to end the game they can just type "exit"   

The game will then display a summary of all the games played, the wins, draws and losses. Have fun!
